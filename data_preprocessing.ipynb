I can't get myself to get out of bed no matter how much i try, my family understands but do still not approve since my grades dropped from all A's to E-C. It has been like this for 1-2 years now and none of my friends understands how It's like, I can't really blame them either since I don't like talking about it and i've always been taught to be a man and keep this stuff to myself. They just see a lazy fuck who is too irresponsible to go too school, same with my teachers. Idk if typing here is going to help at all but if anyone has some tips/advice on how to get motivated again i would be super happy.\n",
