"I saw this tumblr post going around the internet telling people to start the new year going to bed early and waking up refreshed, and I thought hell yes that sounds really nice, I should do that.

"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"".

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can‚Äôt help to think that I‚Äôm fat even though I have an average BMI at 5‚Äô5‚Äù , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day.

"For some of us, 2017 sucked. Relationships, friends (or lack of), grades, lost loved ones - whatever it may be, maybe this year was garbage. Personally (22/M), I just spent my fifth consecutive New Years alone - sitting here wondering why I'm still incapable of making any notable friendships at what some people consider to be the best/easiest age to socialize and make friends. Despite that, I'm convinced that sitting here listening to the fireworks alone isn't all that life has to offer - and maybe a change in attitude/habits will help me next year. By extension, I sincerely hope everyone reading this will have a better 2018 in whatever aspect of life is holding you down.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this. So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening. We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there. This has me so preoccupied omg.",0,,0,,hi so i would like to know what s your opinion on this so there was an activity at my college in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it when they came the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal we students of the college itself are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself charging us a lot of money for things that are not there so we unleashed decided to take back what s ours one guy printed out a lot maybe like tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves so at the end of the day the food was done earlier than usual we did it only for days out of the days the whole college stuff was happening we didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket so we didnt go also because they were being suspicious and asking questions do you think we are getting punished it was only like juice boxes and sandwiches that s it out of the probably or there were there this has me so preoccupied omg,212

It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting.

It‚Äôs hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I‚Äôve never been the same since then. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again.

"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult. I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again. The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate. I feel like my only desires are to pass the time until I can die without hurting my loved ones, and to minimize any negative impact I may have on those around me along the way.

"These boards are riddled with self contempt and self loathing, which is naturally what you might expect on depression boards. Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful. I've been a long time lurker on these forums, also suffering myself, and I see that many people feel support and solidarity with those suffering here.

"I always feared people's judgement. I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider. I always kept to myself. No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either. I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved. I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely. I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends. I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough. The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people. I have seen how people treat others who are different. They can be mean and cruel. Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise. I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it. People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself? I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all.

"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now.. I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then. Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never sure until now. And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do. Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse. And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again..

"For half a year now I'm fighting a fight I can't seem to win. It's like I never even turned 19 this summer. I started university this fall and got together with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She was so supportive and caring that she was afraid to speak about her own problems. She broke up with me because of that a week ago. I made her feel worse, it's my fault she broke up with me. The whole second half of 2016 is a blur. Since I've been diagnosed with severe depression in August I tried medication and am currently in therapy. It kinda helps but over the past week I thought a lot. I don't think I can do this.

"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically. The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness? Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will. So why not die?",0,,1,i want to die,this might sound ridiculous but i want to die and i m not severely depressed i m approaching this purely philosophically the way i see it my life is more suffering than joy and that s probably not going to change in fact i would say this is true of most people we spend most of our time doing things we don t want to do working cleaning driving in traffic feeling hungry experiencing physical discomfort etc etc why would it not be better to not exist at all i don t believe in an afterlife rather than experience the totality of consciousness now other people will mourn my death this much is true but they re going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens no mourning is avoided by making it happen now if anything i m at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will so why not die,169

"Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field. I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore. I have always felt that since I've dealt with depression for such a long time I would always find a way to function. This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do? A little background on me: I have zero friends as the one or two I did have turned out weren't the people I thought they were. I take care of an elderly parent.

"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company. I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period. I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it. Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort. When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours. I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain. I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then. Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf.

"Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far: I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. Sex drive has plummeted. Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness.

They don't accept a lot of things about me and I'm constantly berated by them. Their marriage isn't great either and a lot of times, they displace that anger onto me verbally. It's New Years Eve and I'm in my room alone, since they were arguing earlier and I dont have any friends to hang out with. The only thing thats keeping me going is knowing that this is the last new years eve that I'm stuck in this hell. I will be moving out next year for college as an adult. I will finally be in charge of my life and its going to be up to me what kind of environment i will be in. I won't constantly be subjected to their bullshit anymore.

"Hi all. Hope you are doing well. Just want to start off by saying thank you for hanging in there and sticking through tough times. I hope on everything good in this world there will be compassionate people to be with you throughout your journey. And I hope that one day you might be that compassionate person for someone else.

I know I have depression (at least I believe I do with my family history). But I usually find myself getting depressed about things I see in the world. For example just seeing how much sex is exploited. Just seeing the thumbnails of YouTube videos of women showing off their breasts and how these videos have millions of views. It just bums me out. Seeing hate and violence on tv. It really just gets to me. I start getting really upset when I see how shallow/ easily tempted/ lead people are. Is this normal? Is it the world doing this to me, or is it my mind? I've basically lost everything these past few weeks..my belief in a god, my friends, my hopes. I now have only one real person I can talk to. I want out. And I've had enough, where is there for a person like me in the world to live ? Please anyone, comment your thoughts on this. What gets you depressed ?

Never went to a cool festival. Never had a great party. Never hosted one either. The list goes on and on and on. I feel lonely and my depression is physically weighing down on me. I have no motivation to do anything any more and my parents say they can read that off my face. I legit cannot remember the last time I had fun. Why would I even bother going on like this when I feel like I am just surviving each day rather than living. I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed.

"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like, well, what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve.

"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week.

She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me. Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis. I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things. Is there a way to just power through life?

"I used to have a great social life. Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text. It was one of the happiest times of my life. It was great until the next school year. Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons. When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school. Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill. I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text. I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school. My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in. In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school. I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone. I feel like I'm missing out on what should be the best years of my life. I don't think I'll ever experience going to parties, having a girlfriend, or doing other stuff teenagers are supposed to.

"I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then.

"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem.

"A crisp white coating engulfed the road at 5am. Another sleepless night, another crunchy step taken on the path to escape. It's like a deathbed, cold yet in a way comforting. The dimly lit roads winding through the hills all seemingly leading nowhere but in an endless circle. A cruel metaphor of life. Trapping once beautiful souls, emptying them, and leaving nothing but a mere skeleton. A real world dementor. Intercepting excitement during the most joyous time of the year. Holiday spirit flows through the air but all you can feel is the dark aura you are confronted with. Yet somehow I'm coming to accept that it's okay. A newfound serenity in an alternate state. One where my writing has meaning again, a true reflection. All this sounds more beautiful in my head. Like a poetic verse that captures the slight feelings I still have within me. The written words that fill the void of those that can no longer be spoken.",0,,0,,a crisp white coating engulfed the road at am another sleepless night another crunchy step taken on the path to escape it s like a deathbed cold yet in a way comforting the dimly lit roads winding through the hills all seemingly leading nowhere but in an endless circle a cruel metaphor of life trapping once beautiful souls emptying them and leaving nothing but a mere skeleton a real world dementor intercepting excitement during the most joyous time of the year holiday spirit flows through the air but all you can feel is the dark aura you are confronted with yet somehow i m coming to accept that it s okay a newfound serenity in an alternate state one where my writing has meaning again a true reflection all this sounds more beautiful in my head like a poetic verse that captures the slight feelings i still have within me the written words that fill the void of those that can no longer be spoken,165

"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights. What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten. If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end? Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair. But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation.

"My high school career wasnt the best but it certainly was full of great memories and long term friendships *(some of which I am still in contact with over a decade later)*. Whenever I go through old pictures or Facebook posts/messages from my high school days, I instantly feel sad and depressed because of how much fun those days were and that I can never re-live those amazing days ever again. What makes this feeling worse is that I've lost contact with many of my close high school friends so even if I wanted to get in contact with them again, it couldnt happen. Some I know have moved to different cities/countries and some now have families and established careers and im just sitting here going through old memories wishing that I could re-live those days. We're all happy when high school is finally over but many years later, that feeling isnt the same anymore. I know its not just me who feels this way but this feeling F'ing sucks and at the same time I dont want to get rid of those memories that keep bringing those feelings back because they mean a lot to me.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care.

And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad. I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it.

"Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period.

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed. Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to.

"A bit of background. There's this guy who I used to be great friends with in high school. Now we go to same college and we still have some of the same friends, but he's no longer in our main group of friends. I still talk to him from time to time, but we're not the ""talk everyday"" type of friends. I was bored on Reddit recently so I decided to check his profile because he posts his own music and some stupid (in a good way) jokes sometimes, and I wanted to check it out. I found his post here from a few weeks ago and I realized he broke up with his girlfriend, flunked a few classes, feels like he doesn't have anyone to talk to, and is really depressed h. He didn't show up to a party we threw some time ago but we assumed that it was because of his grades. Now we found out he's going through issues. We resolved to invite him to more stuff and reach out to him. We're also putting together a ""grades rehab crew"" to help tutor him next semester. What else can we do to help him through this? For example, is it wise to ask people we know in his college block about the situation? Do we tell him we saw his post? I really wanna help my friend out.

"Things that didn't bother me in the past are now sending me into a deep depression. You know when you're talking to someone about something you're passionate about, but they just dont care? You know when that seems to happen with every interest and every person? Thats happening to me constantly lately. I guess it always did but I didnt think about it so hard in the past. Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"", ""nice"", ""lol"", ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad.

I've come to say that you all can do it, everyone of you can achieve and be something greater. It may seem like it's impossible for some, but life is a hard, hard road. You don't have to be depressed to know life is quite the bitch and throws you around all the time. But having the strength to keep going and fighting for yourself is what keeps us all here.

"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course?

"Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since.

"Hey ya'll. Hope everyone is having a decent start to the new year. I wanted to see if anybody here had success with cutting back on alcohol consumption, and could potentially talk a little about how it helped them manage their depression. I drink too much. I know it's not good for me (in more ways than one, IBS, depression, anxiety). But I have a really hard time stopping. When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point. After getting an app to track my drinking, recommended by my therapist, I notice I'm drinking like 5-7 nights out of the week. And right now I'm drunkenly writing this up.

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice?

"I'm a 20 year old male college student. Before college and the year and a half hell I've been living in, I always felt like happiness did not come easily to me. I recognized early on that unlike my friends, I had to actively work for any semblance of happiness and peace. Once I started college, my old friend sexual performance anxiety came back full force and hasn't left. Being at one of the nations biggest party schools and mecca for beautiful girls my age, feeling left out of the one thing that all human cultures around the world share feels bad man. This has created a gaping hole inside me that I fill with booze and pot. I've been at rock bottom for a while now, and I know that recovering from this depression and involuntary celibacy will be the hardest battle I've yet to fight in my life. I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet. Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you. After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change.

"I'm posting here for the first time on my main reddit account. People I know will probably see this, they'll probably laugh, but I don't care anymore. I need to vent my feelings someplace. I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help.

"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now.

"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a person‚Äôs psyche‚Ä¶ I like to think I introspect a lot and I‚Äôm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that i‚Äôve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me.

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics. Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal. It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide. She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it. If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient. This is just not a possibility with her at this moment. There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do. I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help. If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.

But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. I‚Äôm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they‚Äôre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Year‚Äôs Eve they‚Äôve ever had and same applies to me because I‚Äôm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her. These things are so important for me right now because I realized I‚Äôm really deep in my depression again and struggling with my current situation.

"The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet.",0,,1,decide if I want to die,the method of suicide i selected is hypothermia there s a river near my house with degree water fahrenheit degrees celsius being in there at night no one would see me i would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so i don t drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water and unconsciousness would happen before then this method is easy to pull off because it doesn t involve highly intense pain and i can get out if i really want to the problem is that this isn t going to work soon due to the warmer seasons approaching i have to quickly decide if i want to die i m afraid that if i don t act now i ll regret it and have to endure life for another year but i m also not set on death just yet,165

You can look through my post history if you want. Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

"I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was. Every time I try to talk about my issues, I end up asking the same questions over and over, borderline asking people to shower me with complements and reminders of my good qualities. My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true.

"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow. However, lately I've been feeling this is my only good quality, being a utility to others. People only keep me around and talk to me because they know I would always agree to helping them out. They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them. Recently, I sent an email to my boss (who I'm pretty close with) with an organized spreadsheet for a work task (something I had not been asked to do, and was my boss's job), and they replied telling me ""You're amazing! Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"". Comments that like sting for me rather than lift me up because they just further validate my belief that I am only a utility to others, and that if I weren't useful, they would ice me out in a second.

"All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before.

A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches.

So since the last 2 weeks, I‚Äôm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes.

"Hello there... My name is Daniel, I am almost 18, ukrainian student in Poland. Recently I've found out that I'd done nothing, and hadn't learned anything compared to my friends, and the reason of It is my laziness. I've tried a lot of different activities, but was to lazy to deal more time for them. As a result - I have problems with extra weight, so I also blame myself for it, because girls think I am ugly... Because of it I'm now in a deep depression for like a year and a half now and I don't know what to do. I can't find any new friends, because I'm scared of people and what they would think about me...

"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes.

Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive). A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"". But I get told to change.

A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that.

But when I'm a broken, autistic shell of a human, it's nearly impossible to want to get up and do what I need to to live. I just want to get some heroin, a tent, and go live in a gutter till I eventually die. I cant live without getting high on *something*. I just want weed but noo my family doesn't understand so they won't help with that so I'm slowly dying from a mixture of cough pills and OTC pain meds.

"On the last day of 2017 I've decided that 2018 will either be my make or break year. 2017 has been a shit show. Not too different from previous years but this one just takes the cake. Literally the most disappointing,heartbreaking year ever. Too painful to even write out here, I just want to forget. Sometimes the only way i can sleep is thinking about dying. Sometimes i hope that i just wont wake up at all. There was a light at the end of the tunnel towards the end of the year but once I started to become happy it, of course, all cam crashing down. Ironically, once i tried to become closer to God and be a better person it all went to hell. I hate being depressed. I want this to be the last new years I spend crying and miserable. So I'm making this post,for myself, to come back to it on december 31 2018. I want to remember exactly where i am, crying in bed after getting off of a late Saturday night shift. Sad about ""him"". It's 5 am. You just took a double dose of melatonin followed by a few gulps of Nyquil just to try and get through the night. This time next year I want to be in a better place. Academically, spiritually, relationship wise. I want to be happy. If not I might just have to give up.

"I'm 20, and a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression in high school, but thought I got over it for the most part. When I'm at college and surrounded by friends, I feel great. But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified. I don't know if it's anxiety or depression or a mix of both, but I just feel like trash and I don't want to exist (no worries though; I'd be posting this on r/suicidewatch if i thought I was actually considering acting on that feeling.) I am sad. I don't have friends at home really, and I guess this has me all wondering, am I just predisposed to being sad? Like if I'm only happy when I'm busy and with other people, then is my natural state of being just being a pile of shit? And does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm good as long as I'm distracted I guess. But when I'm on break, all I do is lay in bed and fuck around with the computer or video games. I have nothing to do or think about, so the things I end up thinking about are all negative. I don't hate myself or anything; I'm just sad and don't really wanna be (be as in exist, not as in ""don't wanna be sad,"" i now see how the syntax there mighta been confusing) (though ideally i wouldn't be sad either) (lastly feel like i gotta say it one more time: seriously am not gonna kill myself.

"There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around.

"When i lived in the states, i had no healthcare so if i wanted anti depressants and counselling, i had to pay out of pocket. i was 15 when i was diagnosed. my mom was working overtime to support me and my two younger siblings, there was no way she could afford mental health help on her own and she made that clear to me. Now that i live in kenya the mental health resources are even more strained and the stigma is worse for seeking them. when i try to talk to people about how i'm feeling they either make me feel worse or tell me they're sorry cause they don't know what to say. and why should they? none of them are licensed therapists. i'm at a point where i need intense professional help but can't get it so my best bet is to do whatever makes me feel better, no matter how harmful it actually is.",1,need intense professional help but can't get it,0,,when i lived in the states i had no healthcare so if i wanted anti depressants and counselling i had to pay out of pocket i was when i was diagnosed my mom was working overtime to support me and my two younger siblings there was no way she could afford mental health help on her own and she made that clear to me now that i live in kenya the mental health resources are even more strained and the stigma is worse for seeking them when i try to talk to people about how i m feeling they either make me feel worse or tell me they re sorry cause they don t know what to say and why should they none of them are licensed therapists i m at a point where i need intense professional help but can t get it so my best bet is to do whatever makes me feel better no matter how harmful it actually is,163

I just dont think that I can ever have a functional relationship because of how bad my depression is. Also, I think that people get bored of me and see me as worthless sometimes. It really just hurts because I really feel worthless. Sorry this is all just complaining. I am just so hurt right now and I feel hopeless. Like I am not going to go anywhere in life.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person.

"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me. I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come. I'm supposed to live for 60+ more years like this?

"I told myself to keep a fair amount of distance between myself and anybody back in high school, but you don't really change much when you get in college. I fell in love, and I tried to push out that thought. One sided on my part completely. Before that, you and I were really close. But it turns out you were the same as anyone I tried to get close with. As soon as we get close, the further away we became. I wasn't oblivious to people pushing me away back then. I knew the signs, I know how to read in between the lines. So why give me mixed messages? The amount of stress that whole thing caused me thinned out my hair. I already hate falling for someone, or in any case get too close with just about anyone, and then I had to trust you. I shouldn't have. I should have just kept you at bay like everyone else.

Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that.

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess.

I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent.

"Hi, does anyone else cope pretty well during the day (by keeping busy, staying relatively productive thus numbing out your emotions) and then completely fall apart at night?

Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not?

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping. Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance. So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way.

"I should be happy. I have a job and a man who loves me and I live in a beautiful place because of him. I feel bad for feeling bad. All the shit in my life, the pain, the abuse, the rape...I don't even know if that's what hurts or if it's just the existential dread that I am nothing and am useless. I don't know if finishing grad school will even make me happy, because how could I ever be happy? I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness.

"It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in.

My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place.

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I have dead eyes. All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago.

"Hello :) I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life. I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself. I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically. So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. Who knows? It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on. Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of.

Word travels fast in my family, and I believe I've ruined New Years for everyone. I dont want to face everyone anymore. None of them understand what I'm going through.

After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey.

"About two years ago, I was having issues with my mental health, and I was given Prozac. After a week or two - I can't remember the exact time - I had something that I think might have been a psychotic break of sorts. I cannot remember my line of thinking at the time, but long story short, I found myself walking down the road (meaning I had walked down my driveway which is all jagged rock and about a mile long, and about another mile down the road). My pocket was full of pills and a knife-like object. I believe I was headed to a pizza place which is miles and miles away.

I know that I Was alienated by other people since middleschool and I newer really learned to interact with others. At that time I didn't really think my Situation is bad... Maybe that was because I didn't have much experience and I knew atleast how to physically defend my self.

"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.",1,feeling alone,0,,i m a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends a job that s steadily decreasing my hours no car and no real hobbies i ve struggled between keeping myself entertained keeping my depression at bay and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization but i feel like no matter what i do i always end up feeling alone i used to be parts of groups used to make friends in school used to have things to do outside the house but now i feel like i m going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them the worst part is feeling alone when i m surrounded by people i was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home i ve always considered myself an extrovert but lately i ve found it hard to connect with people even in my own home where i have a few roommates i feel like nothing i do to interact with them is ever enough one of them is obsessed with his video games one is barely ever home and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that i always feel like i m bothering her when i try to hang out and now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our new years plans for valid reasons but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone now i m ringing in the new year crying and writing this down hoping if i make sense of my crippling loneliness then there s hope in i can do something about it,289

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me... I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do.

"Hi guys, Looking for any help I can get! I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing).

I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit.

"I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline. For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression. I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken.

"28F. My husband wanted to move from West coast to the East coast. Here we are 5 months later. I hate my job and most coworkers.

"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to.

"I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I‚Äôll give you some backstory: I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people‚Äôs expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I‚Äôm now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don‚Äôt know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I‚Äôve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it‚Äôs driving me up a wall. 2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven‚Äôt done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn‚Äôt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for.

"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry. WHAT I'M REALLY WONDERING IS: I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not. I want to ask a professional but, I can't tell my mom... so, I came here to ask if anyone knows what this could mean. And if you've experienced this too.

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse. My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy. Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing. These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family.

"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up. In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people all around the world who listen/watch him. As he goes on, it gets harder for him to talk about it, and it reaches the point where he breaks down, where just describing the messages puts him in tears, as you can tell how much he cares for these people and how much he can empathise with them. But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter?

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise. It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together. So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay.

"Depression it‚Äôs a bitch. Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don‚Äôt deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn‚Äôt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are.",1,forever trapped in an abyss,1,better to just end it all,depression it‚äôs a bitch its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless pathetic useless a failure a disappointment that you don‚äôt deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain it makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again no matter how much you try to escape the darkness your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it you begin to doubt everything about yourself telling yourself whatever you do isn‚äôt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all you feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives all the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel you cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are,262

Perhaps I misunderstood what you were trying to tell me. I can't speak or think for you. So when I wrote you a message telling you how I felt, you read it, and you never replied back, deleted me, dropped me; completely eradicating my existence a year after I left, I still held that note. Did you hold mine? I would appreciate a response from you, even if it's this late in time. I just want to hear it from you. Why you spent time with me, and why you wrote me that letter.

"I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does. The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me. In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life.

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind.

"It's six hours until New Year here and I just want to curl up and die. I've had depression for as long as I can remember but it recently has become worse. My boyfriend of 2 and a half years (who I live and work with) broke up with two weeks ago. Tonight he has gone to one of our colleagues house parties, I wasn't invited. No one invited me anywhere and I don't blame them. I'm not angry that he went, I am angry at myself. I have no friends, live miles away from any family and at the age of almost 28 have nothing to live for. I try to stay upbeat but I really don't see the point. I've alienated myself from everyone and this is what I get.

"I wish it would go away. My brain struggles to handle the fact that nothing matters and becomes disgusted with things like religion that give hope. Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless. Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control. I had no choice in my existence. Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for. I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events. How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me? I guess I'll try to answer for myself. I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose. Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough. I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess. I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard. Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first. As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate. The real struggle is to create something more. I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree. I can just end the suffering, the pain, the world, MY world, at any time.

I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault.

"I am not much of a people person, more often than not I am forgotten. People don't gravitate towards me, rather, they tend to stay away. I try to be sociable, and pleasant, and kind, but it doesn't seem to matter. People have already made up their minds about me, which is sad, but true. Some people are just born with it, I guess. No one wants me in his/her life, there are far better people out there. People who can sustain a conversation, and be confident and lively. I am not that person, I used to be, but not anymore. That part of me is gone, and I don't see it coming back. I fill my time now with other pursuits, mainly writing and creating videos, neither of which are good. My writing is terrible and my videos make no sense. Hell, I tried to make a serious video today, but had to play it off like a comedy because it was downright awful. I can't even vocalize my feelings properly, nor have anyone truly listen to what I have to say. There is no point in trying anymore, I feel like giving up. There is a strange sense of calm to that realization, and it feels more comforting than it should. I wish it could be different, but sadly, there is no other way. I suck at everything, except being sad, which ironically enough is what I am trying to rid.

"Somebody I care very much for has been on escitalopram for years due to crippling depression. He had been taking 10mg every night for years but about 2 months ago he started taking 20mg every night (2 of the 10mg tabs). His doctor said this was fine and last month he filled a prescription for the 20mg tablets which he's been taking since. Now, for the past week and a half, he's been feeling very emotional and out of control and the past 3 or 4 days he just can't stop crying, even at work. Every little thing upsets him to the point of tears and when he talks, he almost sounds like he's drunk. Of course, him being so emotional, he won't go to the doctor because he feels like it would be wasting the doctor's time.

"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide. I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine. But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide. I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled. One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank. When I think about the meaning of life I always come to the conclusion that I want to marry a wonderful woman, have kids and grow old and die of old age, and this is the other thing keeping me alive.

"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone.

"Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain. A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently.

It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression.

"This is a tough time of year for me. It always has been. I don't feel like I belong at parties or gatherings or in any particular set of circumstances associated with this time of year. I just want to be alone at home, unfettered by expectations to be cheerful or give or get gifts. Christmas and New Year's are over, and I still feel this melancholy weight blanketing me that won't go away. But I'm expected to go to work parties and parties with friends and partake in festivities that I do not at all take pleasure in. I'm expected to smile and participate in these rituals, even by the people who know me well enough to know that I want to be miles away from anything to do with a holiday.

"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression. Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction.

I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious.

"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less. I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol.

I'm having such a hard time dealing with lack of focus in my entire life. It makes me feel like garbage and a waste of space to grace this planet. I swear everyone around me has passions and potential and a drive to succeed in one area or another yet I have taken such a long time to come to terms with myself and its still not there! I'm surrounded by confidence and go getters and i know deep down that i could go and try and do all of these things that i want to experience but when push comes to shove i find it impossible to justify it or sometimes even remember what it was i wanted to do. This lack of passion for life gets me down every bloody day and I just want it to go away so that i can become comfortable with myself and have an casual epiphany that will allow me to move on a get on with my life.,0,,0,,i m having such a hard time dealing with lack of focus in my entire life it makes me feel like garbage and a waste of space to grace this planet i swear everyone around me has passions and potential and a drive to succeed in one area or another yet i have taken such a long time to come to terms with myself and its still not there i m surrounded by confidence and go getters and i know deep down that i could go and try and do all of these things that i want to experience but when push comes to shove i find it impossible to justify it or sometimes even remember what it was i wanted to do this lack of passion for life gets me down every bloody day and i just want it to go away so that i can become comfortable with myself and have an casual epiphany that will allow me to move on a get on with my life,169

"I had someone I barely know trying to offer advice last night. He's one of those ""you should go seek help"" types. No shit - wouldn't that be nice? I *did* when I had the ""luxury"" of health insurance. I'm on my own now, though, and am doing my fucking best. It felt like it came out of nowhere, too, when he initiated the call and wanted to hear me participate more in voice with group chats. I'd made jokes about needing time to remember how to speak after so much tension with family, and think he may have gotten the wrong impression. He started offering new employment routes, which, while appreciated, also just overwhelmed me even more. I'd already told him that I technically have two businesses, one teaching guitar and the other gardening. He was offering stuff completely unrelated and out of my field. I'd like to look into them, but I have multiple learning disabilities and mental illnesses over here.

"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good.

I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us.

I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. I do have other stuff to do.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room. However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health.

"So like many of us, I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation , and it was incredible. It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person. Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it, thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds. Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. Went back to the doctor. We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes. I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also. i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do. i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years. I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa. but i've not been able to find it. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me? what is the next step? any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next?",0,,0,,so like many of us i ve suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life pretty severe depression to be honest about years ago i started taking celexa under my general practitioners recommendation and it was incredible it made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like i was a new person eventually i stupidly weaned off it thinking i was cured and went for about ish years not on any meds eventually i predictably fell back into my depression went back to the doctor we tried celexa again didn t work wasn t anything like the first time then put me on wellbutrin didn t really work either then we finally tried effexor same deal didn t notice any positive changes i don t exactly remember but i believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also i m getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do i ve been struggling finding the right meds now for years i would give anything to go back to that clear happy feeling i got from my first batch of celexa but i ve not been able to find it does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me what is the next step any other meds that i might recommend to my doctor to try next,223

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug?

"I grabbed a pile of old pictures that were close to my heart and pills. I locked the door and layed out the pictures which included pictures of my mom when she was young me as a kid my dad and my siblings.

I grab them open them and then i turn the cup upside down which resulted the pills touching my mouth. Then it came to me.

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore. I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy. I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass. Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life.

If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me.

"Hello, happy new year etc, etc. Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway. I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind. I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here.

However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"". Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends) As for my family, they call my childish and say I have no reason to be depressed.

"Over the past several months, I've had some incredible highs and some incredible lows. I had been really struggling for a few months, but lately I seemed to be on an upswing. Something about NYE really brought me down though. The night itself seems to synonymous with ""fresh starts"" and ""new beginnings."" For me, it felt lonely. Since NYE I've been super depressed again - defined by the idea that I am not hopeful and any fresh start I have will inevitably lead to another dead end. Will a fresh start change the way I look or change how attractive I am? Will a fresh start make me more likable? More outgoing? More equipped to make friends and meet new people?

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs helping or not, because some days, both before and after starting the SSRI, I feel normal and friendly, others I feel angry and unable to have a conversation with anyone because I fear talking to other people so much, and also because the thoughts and images in my head are racing so fast I cannot slow them down fast enough to collect a thought to speak.

The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun.

"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now?

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear. Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this?

Any way, I am not depressed but many of you guys have similar problems based on some posts I have seen. Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry.

"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave. I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all. This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it. Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",0,,0,,i went to a club with pretty good djs last night i went there last year as well and enjoyed it last night though at first i was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and i got this overwhelming feeling that i should leave i have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of nye my mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there i just couldn t escape what i was feeling my girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn t understand why i wanted to leave after having a bit of a row i just yelled it s because i m fucking depressed and left by myself i have feelings of guilt obviously i know she wanted me there but i let this mood i m having control what i do it must have looked strange to everyone and i feel like i wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun having said that the feeling i had making me want to leave was so overwhelming i wouldn t have enjoyed myself at all this scares me this hasn t happened before i am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends for the past couple of weeks though i ve had this feeling that i just want to stay in bed and do nothing finally last night i acted on it is this depression i really can t tell if i am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it,277

"1. ""You just have to wait for the right time. Stop trying. You're still young. You'll find the right person eventually."" This is literally just you pushing the problem off onto whoever I'm with the next time I'm having a bad day. And not everyone does fall in love. I find it more likely I'll be dead before that ever happens. 2. ""You have to love yourself before anyone else will love you."" Then I guess I'm fucked. I don't love me. I despise me. So does everyone else. That's why I'm here. 3. ""Being in a relationship won't fix your depression."" No shit. But you know what, I'm pretty sure having someone around who tells me they love me and hugs me when I'm sad sure wouldn't make things any worse. 4. ""You just gotta get out there and meet more people."" Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it.

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications? The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise. Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.

"Well its been 2 hours since the first humans on the planet began experiencing 2018. And yeah, life might be a meaningless and near endless well of suffering, but on the flip side the worse life is, the stronger we are for having gotten through it. Cheers to you all. Here's to another year of depression, and hopefully the last for many - that is, the last because happiness waits around the corner and if we keep fighting we'll get there soon.

"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear. So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes. The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but... This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope? TL;DR: I kept buying socks while super depressed. Started doing laundry and now have a fuckton of them.

"I feel as if people are ignoring me and what I say now. Some of my friends have become really popular and whenever I say hi or call their name they either look at me like they don't know me or just flat out disregard that I'm even talking to them. Barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. My crush has seen me at my desk when I'm going through a rough time but she just ignores me. She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there.
